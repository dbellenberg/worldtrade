# Global Value Chains and International Trade Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing global value chains (GVCs) and traditional international trade data from 1995 to 2020. The dashboard displays export and import data for countries across 45 different product categories.

# Introduction

GVCs are a key aspect of modern international trade, breaking up the production process across countries. Firms specialize in specific tasks rather than producing the whole product. GVCs enable firms to raise their productivity and income, while countries partake in GVCs in various ways, such as exporting raw materials or innovative finished products. This project aims to provide a better understanding of international trade, focusing on both GVC and traditional trade.

# Data Source

The original dataset was obtained from the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS), which is a software developed by the World Bank in collaboration with several other organizations. WITS provides knowledge on international merchandise trade, tariff, and non-tariff trade. The dataset used in this project covers gross trade, GVC trade, and traditional trade, expressed in millions of US Dollars.

Please note that the dataset is assumed to be in nominal terms, as there is no indication of a price index being used to adjust for inflation.

# Getting Started

Dependencies
pandas
Python Script
The Python script main.py processes and cleans the dataset, focusing on GVC and traditional trade data. It includes functions to import datasets, filter and merge them, convert country abbreviations to full names, and clean the dataset. The script can be executed by running the main() function.

# Dashboard

The dashboard displays export and import data for countries, as well as the trade of 45 different product categories. It allows users to conduct in-depth analysis for specific years or examine overall trends in international trade from 1995 to 2020.
